I am currently looking for backend software work, senior level. Majoring in PHP or TypeScript, minoring in devops
for all hosted platforms.  Please contact me through the platform you found me on. This README is intended to be
a better summary of my work  profile than a bare repo list. Most of my outside-work code is in private repos.
Feedback welcome!
