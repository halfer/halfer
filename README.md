I am currently looking for backend software work, senior level. Majoring in PHP or TypeScript, minoring in devops for all
hosted CI platforms. I am UK-based and prefer fully/mostly remote. Please contact me through the platform you found me on.
This README is intended to be a better summary of my work profile than a bare repo list. Most of my outside-work code is
in private repos. Feedback welcome!
