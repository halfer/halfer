I am currently looking for backend software work, senior level. Majoring in PHP or TypeScript, minoring in devops
for all hosted platforms.  Please contact me through the platform you found me on. This README is intended to be
a better summary of my work  profile than a bare repo list. Most of my outside-work code is in private repos.
Feedback welcome!

👨‍🏫 Currently volunteering as a coach at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/)  
🤖 I'm building an AI / ChatGTP project with two product SMEs (all under wraps for now)  
😇 I used to teach in-person PHP, and wrote [this tutorial](https://ilovephp.jondh.me.uk/)  
↔️ I've written some useful utilities, such as this [shared-hosting file sync system](https://github.com/halfer/ftp-sync)
⚡️ I did some experiments [with Docker Swarm](https://github.com/halfer/cd-demo-container)  
  and [here's another one](https://github.com/halfer/htauth-swarm-demo)
